# time_series
Some works where I used time series.

FED MODEL:

the Fed model is an empirical model that can be categorized as an arbitrage model. 
The Fed model is based on the idea that there is an arbitrage relationship between the remuneration of a government bond, 
which is deemed to be risk-free, and the rate of return on a stock. 

In this work I show the limitation of linear models and I show the advanges of a time-series approach.
